2.
We need to change the heuristic function to work with portals
, so that it calculates with the position of the portal exit instead
of the portal entrance

3.
The algorithm doesn't terminate because an algorthim can't know if it terminates,
 see the Halting problem.

 4.The Breadth First search has a time complexity O of all Edges plus all Vertexes, because
 in the worst case, every node is visited. The space complexity is O(IVI), but when expending,
 the Frontier grows exponantally.
